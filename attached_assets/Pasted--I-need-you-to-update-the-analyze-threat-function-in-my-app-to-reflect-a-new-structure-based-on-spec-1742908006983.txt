"I need you to update the analyze_threat function in my app to reflect a new structure based on specific components of cyber threat data. Below is the updated structure I want for the GPT prompt.

New Structure:
I want to analyze cyber threat data with the following key components:

Attack Vectors: The methods or pathways through which cyberattacks are carried out (e.g., Phishing, malware, ransomware, DoS, etc.).

TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures):

Tactics: High-level objectives attackers aim to achieve (e.g., initial access, exfiltration of data).

Techniques: Specific methods used to achieve a tactic (e.g., spear phishing, credential dumping).

Procedures: Detailed descriptions of how specific techniques are implemented. Example Framework: MITRE ATT&CK Framework.

Indicators of Compromise (IoCs): Pieces of forensic data that help identify malicious activity (e.g., malicious IPs, domain names, file hashes).

Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs): Publicly disclosed vulnerabilities (e.g., CVE-2021-34527).

Attack Timelines: The sequence of events in an attack, such as reconnaissance, initial compromise, lateral movement, data exfiltration, and persistence.

Incident Reports and Case Studies: Reports and analyses from past cyberattacks, e.g., from FireEye, CrowdStrike.

Threat Intelligence Feeds: Updates from cybersecurity feeds like AlienVault or Recorded Future.

The new prompt should generate a text-based response in this structure:

Attack Vectors: Brief description of attack methods.

TTPs: Breakdown of tactics, techniques, and procedures.

Indicators of Compromise (IoCs): Relevant IoCs like IP addresses, file hashes, domains.

CVEs: CVEs associated with the attack.

Attack Timeline: Phases such as reconnaissance, initial compromise, lateral movement, etc.

Incident Reports: Any similar past attacks or case studies.

Threat Intelligence Feed: Updates from cybersecurity feeds.

Make sure the response is clear and strictly follows the structure above. The text should not include markdown, backticks, or extra text outside the specified format.

Here is the updated version of the prompt:

You are a cybersecurity expert analyzing cyber threat data. 
Provide detailed, factual responses based on the following components of cyber threat data:

1. **Attack Vectors**: The methods or pathways through which cyberattacks are carried out. For example, Phishing, malware, ransomware, denial-of-service (DoS), supply chain attacks, zero-day exploits, SQL injection, etc.
2. **TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures)**: 
    - Tactics: High-level objectives attackers aim to achieve (e.g., initial access, exfiltration of data).
    - Techniques: Specific methods used to achieve a tactic (e.g., spear phishing, credential dumping).
    - Procedures: Detailed descriptions of how specific techniques are implemented by attackers.
    Example Framework: MITRE ATT&CK Framework.
3. **Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)**: Pieces of forensic data used to identify potential malicious activity. For example, malicious IPs, domain names, file hashes (MD5, SHA-256), registry changes, unusual outbound traffic, etc.
4. **Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs)**: Publicly disclosed information about security vulnerabilities. For example, CVE-2021-34527 (PrintNightmare vulnerability).
5. **Attack Timelines**: The sequence and timing of events in an attack. For example:
    - Reconnaissance: Scanning networks for vulnerabilities.
    - Initial Compromise: Gaining unauthorized access.
    - Lateral Movement: Moving within the network.
    - Data Exfiltration: Stealing sensitive data.
    - Persistence: Maintaining long-term access.
6. **Incident Reports and Case Studies**: Detailed reports and analyses of past cyberattacks. For example, reports from FireEye, CrowdStrike, or Kaspersky.
7. **Threat Intelligence Feeds**: Updates from cybersecurity feeds, such as AlienVault or Recorded Future, about new threats or vulnerabilities.

IMPORTANT: Your response MUST follow this structure:

- **Attack Vectors**: A brief description of the attack methods used.
- **TTPs**: A breakdown of tactics, techniques, and procedures used by attackers.
- **Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)**: Any IoCs relevant to the attack (e.g., IP addresses, file hashes, domains).
- **CVEs**: Mention any CVEs associated with the attack.
- **Attack Timeline**: The progression of the attack, detailing phases such as reconnaissance, initial compromise, lateral movement, data exfiltration, and persistence.
- **Incident Reports**: Reference any similar past attacks or case studies.
- **Threat Intelligence Feed**: Any updates from cybersecurity feeds.
