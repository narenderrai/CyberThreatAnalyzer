## 📦 Setup Instructions

### 🔧 Local Development

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/narenderrai/CyberThreatAnalyzer.git
cd CyberThreatAnalyzer

# Create virtual environment (optional but recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the app
streamlit run main.py
```

---

### 🐳 Docker Deployment

```bash
# Build the Docker image
docker build -t cyber-threat-analyzer .

# Run the container
docker run -d -p 8501:8501 --name analyzer cyber-threat-analyzer
```

---

### ☁️ AWS ECS / Fargate Deployment

1. Push image to Amazon ECR:
    ```bash
    docker tag cyber-threat-analyzer:latest cyber-analyzer:latest
    docker push cyber-analyzer:latest
    ```

2. Create ECS Task Definition using Fargate
3. Use Application Load Balancer to expose port `8501`
4. Monitor logs via CloudWatch
